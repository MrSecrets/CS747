windy_gridworld.py is a class that implements a training environment of windy gridworld

sarsa.py is an implementation of the SARSA algorithm. Running it generates a graph that makes the plot in 4 different scenarios.

qLearning.py is an implemetation of the Q Learning algorithm. Running it generates a graph that makes the plot in 4 different scenarios.

expectedSarsa.py is an implementation of the Expected SARSA algorithm. Running it generates a graph that makes the plot in 4 different scenarios.

benchmark.py generates a comparitive plot of all 3 algorithms in the windy world eniromnet with cartesian movements only

The 4 different scenarios we considered are 

cartisian movement without stochasity in wind
cartisian movement with stochasity in wind
king's movement without stochasity in wind
king's movement with stochasity in wind
